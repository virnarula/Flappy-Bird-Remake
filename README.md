# Flappy Bird for Android
## How it was made
I made this game with the help of Rob Percival's online android development course. All the sprites and images are taken from there
This is a fairly simple game of Flappy Bird made with [libGDX] (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and Java in Anroid Studio.
## How to Contribute
Simply clone the repository and open in Android Studio. You may have to downlaod libGDX for it to work properly.
## Possible Improvements
1. Fix graphics to work with taller screens. The tube is not as tall as some modern phones.
2. Add a leaderboard screen.
3. Add sounds when the bird flaps.
4. Change the angle of the bird sprite when it is falling and flying.
